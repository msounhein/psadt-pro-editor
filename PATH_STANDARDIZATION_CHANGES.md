# Path Standardization Changes

## Overview

This document outlines the changes made to standardize template paths in the PSADT Pro UI application and to implement zip file cleanup after extraction.

## Changes Made

### 1. Standardized Path Structure

All template paths now follow this standardized structure:
```
storage/templates/<user id>/Default/<template id>
```

This structure:
- Uses the user's ID for proper isolation
- Uses the template ID rather than name for uniqueness
- Keeps consistent naming regardless of template type

### 2. Database Updates

- Modified all template records in the database to use the standardized path
- Updated three path fields consistently:
  - `extractionPath` column
  - `metadata.storagePath`
  - `metadata.extractionStatus.path`

### 3. ZIP File Cleanup

- Added code to delete ZIP files after successful extraction
- Created a cleanup script to remove existing ZIP files
- Implemented ZIP file cleanup in the extraction status API

### 4. API Modifications

- Updated the GitHub API to:
  - Use standardized paths when downloading files
  - Clean up ZIP files after extraction
  - More efficient extraction process

- Updated the Extraction Status API to:
  - Always use the standardized path structure
  - Check for and clean up any ZIP files
  - Provide more detailed status information

### 5. Configuration

- Added `FILE_STORAGE_PATH` to the environment variables
- Added storage configuration to config.json
- Created documentation describing the standardized structure

## Testing and Validation

The following tests were performed to validate the changes:

1. Verified database paths were updated to the standardized format
2. Confirmed that all files were copied to the correct locations
3. Verified ZIP files were cleaned up after extraction
4. Checked that legacy paths still work for backward compatibility

## Next Steps

For future development:

1. Enforce the standardized structure in all new code
2. Add validation to ensure paths always follow the standard format
3. Consider adding a migration script for upgrading older installations
4. Implement automated tests that verify path compliance

## Benefits

These changes provide:

1. Consistent structure for easier maintenance
2. Proper multi-user isolation
3. Space savings by removing unnecessary ZIP files
4. More robust extraction and error handling
5. Better organization of template files
