# Template Management Plan

This directory contains documentation and plans for the implementation of the enhanced template management system in PSADT Pro UI.

> **Note:** Implementation has been completed and is now in the testing phase.

## Overview

The template management system allows users to work with both default (official) PSADT templates and custom templates. Default templates provide a starting point and remain unmodified, while custom templates allow for full customization.

## Requirements

1. ✅ Default templates should not be directly editable
2. ✅ Default templates can be cloned to create custom templates
3. ✅ Default templates serve as starting points for package creation
4. ✅ Visual distinction between default and custom templates
5. ✅ Intuitive user flows for template management

## Documentation Files

This directory contains the following documentation:

- **[template-management-plan.md](./template-management-plan.md)**: High-level plan outlining the template management approach
- **[template-implementation-details.md](./template-implementation-details.md)**: Technical details for implementation
- **[template-user-flow.md](./template-user-flow.md)**: User flow diagrams and scenarios
- **[implementation-tasks.md](./implementation-tasks.md)**: Breakdown of implementation tasks and timeline
- **[implementation-summary.md](./implementation-summary.md)**: Summary of implemented changes
- **[template-management-usage.md](./template-management-usage.md)**: Usage guide for the template management system
- **[api-route-samples.md](./api-route-samples.md)**: Sample implementations for API routes

## Implementation Status

The template management system implementation has been completed:

1. **Database Schema Update** ✅
   - Added `type` field to Template model
   - Created migration scripts
   - Successfully migrated existing templates

2. **Backend Implementation** ✅
   - Enhanced `template-management.js` to support Default/Custom template types
   - Added template cloning functionality
   - Created `clone-template-files.ps1` for file operations
   - Implemented template type migration tools
   - Added debugging endpoints for development

3. **Frontend Implementation** ✅
   - Created templates list page with filtering
   - Implemented template cards with type badges
   - Added clone template modal for quick cloning
   - Created dedicated template clone page
   - Updated template detail page to respect template type
   - Added edit protection for Default templates

4. **Current Status**
   - All planned features have been implemented
   - Testing is in progress
   - Preparing for deployment

## Key Concepts

- **Default Templates**: Official PSADT templates downloaded from GitHub, marked as read-only
- **Custom Templates**: User-created or user-modified templates, fully editable
- **Template Cloning**: The process of creating a custom template from a default template
- **Template Type**: A database field and file system organization principle that separates templates into "Default" and "Custom" categories

## Database Changes

The implementation added a `type` field to the Template model in the database schema:

```prisma
type      String   @default("Custom") // "Default" or "Custom"
```

## File System Structure

Templates are organized in the file system by type:

```
/storage/templates/[userId]/
  ├── Default/
  │   └── [Default templates...]
  └── Custom/
      └── [Custom templates...]
```

## UI Changes

The UI has been updated to:
- Display template type badges
- Show appropriate action buttons based on template type
- Add filtering by template type
- Implement clone modal and edit protection for default templates

## Next Steps

1. **Complete Testing**
   - Finish unit and integration testing
   - Perform UI/UX testing
   - Verify accessibility and responsive design

2. **Prepare for Deployment**
   - Document deployment steps
   - Create rollback plan
   - Schedule deployment window

3. **Post-Deployment Verification**
   - Verify database schema in production
   - Test core functionality in production
   - Monitor error logs after deployment

## Documentation Updates

The documentation has been updated to reflect the implementation progress:

1. **Implementation Tasks** ✅
   - Updated to show completed phases
   - Added progress indicators
   - Updated estimated timeline

2. **Implementation Summary** ✅
   - Comprehensive list of all created and modified files
   - Current status of features
   - Migration process details

3. **Usage Guide** ✅
   - Added detailed instructions for the new UI
   - Updated troubleshooting section
   - Added development tools information

The documentation now fully reflects the current state of the implementation and provides clear guidelines for both users and developers.
